          <h2>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT</h2>
          <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. 
          It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages,
          whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user
          and make dynamic pages.It is an interpreted programming language with
          object-oriented capabilities.
        </p>
  
          <p>JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, 
            but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement 
            being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 
            1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been 
            embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
            Overview. JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and
            operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the
            Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript
            as well. ... JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong
            to a type.

          <h2>What can in-browser JavaScript do?</h2>
          <p>Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.
  
            JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.
            
            In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.
  
            That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.
            
            That said, JavaScript also allows to create servers, mobile applications, etc.</p>

          <h2>Client-Side JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

          It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
          
          The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.</p>
          <p>The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.

            JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.</p>

          <h2>How to debug a Script</h2>
          <h3>Use a JavaScript Validator</h3>
          <p>One way to check your JavaScript code for strange bugs is to run it through a program that checks it to make sure it is valid and that it follows the official syntax rules of the language. These programs are called validating parsers or just validators for short, and often come with commercial HTML and JavaScript editors.
  
            The most convenient validator for JavaScript is Douglas Crockford's JavaScript Lint, which is available for free at Douglas Crockford's JavaScript Lint.</p>
          <p>Simply visit that web page, paste your JavaScript (Only JavaScript) code into the text area provided, and click the jslint button. This program will parse through your JavaScript code, ensuring that all the variable and function definitions follow the correct syntax. It will also check JavaScript statements, such as if and while, to ensure they too follow the correct format</p>
